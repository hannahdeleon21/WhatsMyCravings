Create a modern, fully responsive website titled "What's for Lunch".

Home Page (Landing Page):

Centered big title: "What's for Lunch".

Below it, a large, attractive "Get Started" button that smoothly transitions the user to the meal categories page (could be a scroll, a fade, or a page navigation).

Background could have a soft gradient or light texture that feels inviting and food-themed.

Main Page (Categories):

Display three main category cards/buttons:

Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner

Each card should have a food-themed icon or small image and nice hover effects (e.g., card lift, slight zoom, soft glow).

Meal List Page (after clicking a category):

Show a list/grid of meals for the selected category.

Each meal card includes:

Meal name

Short description

Nutritional facts (calories, protein, carbs, fats) inside a neat little table or styled list.

Smooth animations as cards appear (e.g., fade-in, slide-up).

Color Palette (Food-Themed):

Tomato Red #E63946

Avocado Green #A8D5BA

Bread Beige #F5E1A4

Chocolate Brown #5D3A00

Soft white (#FFFFFF) background for Light Mode.

Deep charcoal (#121212) background for Dark Mode.

Responsive Design:

Mobile-first approach.

Cards should stack on mobile screens.

Fluid typography (titles and text resize naturally on different screen sizes).

Dark Mode and Light Mode:

Allow users to toggle between dark and light modes (add a toggle button, maybe in the navbar or floating in the corner).

Automatically switch colors for background, text, cards, and buttons based on the mode.

Animations:

Button hover effects (smooth color changes, slight scale-up).

Card hover effects (lift up, subtle shadow).

Smooth page transitions (like fade or slide effects when navigating).

Use CSS animations or lightweight JS libraries like Framer Motion (if React) or simple Animate.css.

ðŸ›  Bonus (if you want to go extra):
Add a search bar to quickly find meals.
Add a filter/sort feature (sort by calories, protein, etc.).
Smooth scroll between

Add More Meals

Add at least 20 meals per category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).

Each meal must include a name, short description, and full nutritional facts (calories, protein, carbs, fat).

Dark Mode & Light Mode Animation

When switching between dark mode and light mode, apply a smooth animated transition to background, text, header, footer, and card colors (e.g., using CSS transitions or keyframes).

Meal Detail View

When a meal card is clicked, open a detailed view showing:

Meal name

Ingredients list

Full recipe (step-by-step cooking instructions)

Animate the transition into the detail view (e.g., fade-in or slide-up).

Add Footer

Create a footer at the bottom of every page with the text and make it professional:

"De Leon, Matnao, Mendoza All rights reserved. 2025"

Footer background should match the active theme (light or dark).

Update Branding

Change all mentions of the website title to:

"What's My Cravings?"

Update the header and page title accordingly.

Dark Mode Header/Footer Styling

In dark mode, ensure the header and footer also use dark backgrounds and adjust text colors for readability.
